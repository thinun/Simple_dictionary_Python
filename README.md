Simple Dictionary Application

Description:  
This Python script implements a simple dictionary application that allows users to search for the meanings of words. The dictionary data is loaded from a JSON file, and the program provides suggestions for similar words if the exact match is not found.

Features:

Word Meaning Lookup: Users can enter a word, and the application will display its meaning if it exists in the dictionary.

Suggestions: If the entered word is not found in the dictionary, the program suggests similar words based on their similarity to the input.

JSON Data Storage: Dictionary data is stored in a JSON file, allowing persistent storage and retrieval of word meanings across multiple program runs.

Input Validation: The program handles input validation to ensure a smooth user experience and graceful error handling.


Functionality:

Upon execution, the program loads the dictionary data from a JSON file into memory.
Users are prompted to enter a word to search for its meaning.
If the exact word is found in the dictionary, the program displays its meaning.
If the word is not found, the program suggests similar words based on their similarity to the input and prompts the user to confirm the suggestion.
